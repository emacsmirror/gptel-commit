/AI-powered Git commit message generator for Emacs/

/This README was generated with assistance from Claude Sonnet 4/

** Changelog v0.2.0

*** New Features
- Added Claude Code CLI support as an alternative backend to GPTel
- Added debug logging functionality for troubleshooting
- Both streaming and non-streaming modes supported for Claude Code
- Configurable Claude CLI command path

*** Breaking Changes
None

** Features

    ü§ñ Generates commit messages based on staged changes using GPTel or Claude Code

    üí≠ Optional rationale input for complex changes

    üîÑ Streaming support for real-time generation (both GPTel and Claude Code)

    üéØ Smart filtering of lock files and generated code

    üîß Debug logging for troubleshooting

    ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable backend selection

** Installation

gptel-commit is available on MELPA. After setting up MELPA, you can install it with:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package gptel-commit
  :ensure t
  :after (gptel magit)
  :custom
  (gptel-commit-stream t))
#+end_src

Or with =M-x package-install RET gptel-commit RET=.

*** Prerequisites

    Install and configure [[https://github.com/karthink/gptel][gptel]] (for GPTel backend)

    Optionally install [[https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code][Claude Code CLI]] (for Claude Code backend)

    Ensure you have Git installed and accessible from Emacs

** Usage

*** Interactive Functions

Main functions available:

    =M-x gptel-commit= - Generate commit message directly from staged changes

    =M-x gptel-commit-rationale= - Generate with optional rationale/context prompt

*** Magit Integration

When using Magit, these functions work in commit message buffers. You can bind them to convenient keys in your configuration.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'magit
  (define-key git-commit-mode-map (kbd "C-c g") #'gptel-commit)
  (define-key git-commit-mode-map (kbd "C-c G") #'gptel-commit-rationale))
#+end_src

*** With Rationale

When using =gptel-commit-rationale=, you'll be prompted to explain why you're making these changes. This helps the AI generate more meaningful commit messages with proper context.

** Configuration

*** Customization Options

#+begin_src elisp
;; Enable/disable streaming (default: t)
(setq gptel-commit-stream t)

;; Choose backend: use Claude Code instead of GPTel (default: nil)
(setq gptel-commit-use-claude-code t)

;; Claude Code command (default: "claude")
;; Can be absolute path if claude is not in PATH
(setq gptel-commit-claude-command "/path/to/claude")

;; Enable debug logging for Claude Code backend (default: nil)
;; For GPTel debugging, use (setq gptel-log-level 'debug) instead
(setq gptel-commit-claude-debug t)

;; Use a specific GPTel backend for commit messages (when using GPTel)
;; (e.g., a cheaper model via OpenRouter)
;; See https://github.com/karthink/gptel?tab=readme-ov-file#setup for more backend options
(setq gptel-commit-backend (gptel-make-gh-copilot "Copilot"))

;; Exclude files from diff analysis (default patterns shown)
(setq gptel-commit-diff-excludes
      '("pnpm-lock.yaml"
        "*.lock"
        "ent/**/*.go"))

;; Customize the prompt used for generating commit messages
;; Example using Zed editor's commit message prompt style:
;; https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/main/crates/git_ui/src/commit_message_prompt.txt
(setq gptel-commit-prompt
      "You are an expert at writing Git commits. Your job is to write a short clear commit message that summarizes the changes.

If you can accurately express the change in just the subject line, don't include anything in the message body. Only use the body when it is providing *useful* information.

Don't repeat information from the subject line in the message body.

Only return the commit message in your response. Do not include any additional meta-commentary about the task. Do not include the raw diff output in the commit message.

Follow good Git style:

- Separate the subject from the body with a blank line
- Try to limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with any punctuation
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Keep the body short and concise (omit it entirely if not useful)")
#+end_src

*** Hooks

=gptel-commit-after-insert-hook=: run after commit message is inserted.

** How It Works

    Analyzes staged changes using =git diff --cached=

    Filters out excluded files (lock files, generated code, etc.)

    Sends the diff to your configured backend (GPTel or Claude Code) with a specialized prompt

    Formats the response according to conventional Git commit message format

    Inserts the message in your commit buffer

*** Debugging

When =gptel-commit-claude-debug= is enabled, Claude Code debug information is logged to the =*gptel-commit-claude-debug*= buffer, including:
- Backend selection and prompts
- Claude Code CLI commands and arguments
- Raw output and JSON parsing
- Process status and timing information

For GPTel debugging, use =(setq gptel-log-level 'debug)= to enable gptel's built-in logging.

** Tips

    Keep your staged changes focused and logical

    Use the rationale feature for complex changes

    The AI works best with clear, well-structured code changes

    Review and edit the generated message as needed
